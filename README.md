# Roblox FPS unlocker
Simple python script that lets you change your maximum FPS in Roblox.

# Requirements
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/) (I wrote it in 3.11, it might work with older versions.)
- Basic file editing skills
- Roblox (duh)

# Setup
- Step 1: Open the "config.json" file in the root directory with your IDE (or notepad)
- Step 2: Change the `"roblox-path": "C:/Users/"` to a valid path
  - Optionally, you can also change the `"target-fps": "144"` line to any integer you want (DO NOT FORGET THE DOUBLE QUOTES!!!!)
- Step 3: Hit CTRL + S to save
- Step 4: Run Roblox
